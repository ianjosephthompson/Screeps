## Getting Started With Screeps

  * Launch the Screeps game
  * Play the tutorial to generate some default scripts you can learn from and copy!
  * Log into the main server, select your first room, and place your first spawner
  * Now, you can find your local scripts folder by clicking "Open local folder" in the bottom-left
    * For me on Windows10 this was: <My Drive>:\<My Windows Installation>\Users\<<My User>\AppData\Local\Screeps\scripts\screeps<span>.</span>com\default\
    * You'll notice that if you navigate up one level to the /screeps.com/ folder, that your tutorial scripts have been saved in other folders at this location
    * That's because you were running the tutorials in sandbox environments, and now the scripts that you place in your /default/ folder will run on the main server


## Integrating Git

  * After you've been playing for awhile, maybe you realize it would be nice to have some source control!
  * FSetup a new repository and create a directory called "default"
  * Find your local scripts folder by clicking "Open local folder" in the bottom-left
    * For me on Windows10 this was: <My Drive>:\<My Windows Installation>\Users\<<My User>\AppData\Local\Screeps\scripts\screeps<span>.</span>com\default\
  * Copy all your scripts to the "default" folder in your repository
  * Commit yoru code to source control
  * Close Screeps, your IDE, and any terminal windows you used for source control
  * From a new terminal window create a symlink between your repository's "default" folder and the Screeps local scripts folder's "default" folder:
    * on Windows run:
      * mklink /J "path/to/screeps/local/scripts/folder/default" "path/to/repository/default"
    * on Linux run:
      * ln -s "path/to/repository/default" "path/to/screeps/local/scripts/folder/default"
  * Now, your scripts in your repository will be linked into the folder Screeps expects


## Setup Visual Studio: Code for Screeps Development

  * Install Visual Studio: Code
    * In the Extensions menu (Ctrl + Shift + X):
      * Install "GitLens - Git Supercharged" by Eric Amodio
  * Launch the Screeps game and play the tutorial
    * Select your first room and place your spawner
    * Now, find your local scripts folder by clicking "Open local folder" in the bottom-left
      * For me on Windows10 this was: <My Drive>:\<My Windows Installation>\Users\<<My User>\AppData\Local\Screeps\scripts\screeps<span>.</span>com\default\
  * From a terminal window:
      * cd /to/that/local/folder
      * git clone the Screeps Intellisense package as /ScreepsAutocomplete/ into that folder
  * Download the Screeps code references file
      * Place it inside the /ScreepsAutocomplete/ folder
  * Create a new file in the /ScreepsAutocomplete/ folder named "jsconfig.json"
      * Add the following contents to the file:

      { "compilerOptions": { "target": "ES6" }, "exclude": [ "node_modules" ] }

  * From the teriminal window:
    * cd /to/that/local/folder
    * npm install @types/screeps;
    * npm install @types/lodash;
  * Close and reopen Visual Studio: Code
  * Create a ".gitignore" file to make sure you don't commit the /ScreepsAutocomplete/ or /node_modules/ folders
    * But node recommends that you DO commit the "package-lock.json" file
  * Commit your ".gitignore" file and the "package-lock.json" file
